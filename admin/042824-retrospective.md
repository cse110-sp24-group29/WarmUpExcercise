# Agile - RetroSpective


## What went well
- The Team was able to collaborate seamlessly using Slack, ensuring that tasks were efficiently delegated and progress of all tasks involved were communicated effectively.
- We were able to navigate discussions and finalizing decisions seamlessly, devoid of any disagreements.
- Whilst developing the widget, everybody was able to meet deadlines and be very prompt in completing the tasks that needed to be done.
- Members were quick to take initiative on working on new tasks during the project which really improved our efficiency.
- The Team's proficiency in technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enabled us to implement the widget and allowed us to focus more on user experience and satisfaction. We were able to provide features like a navigation bar and a submit button, along with a thank you page and back button.


## What didn't go well
- While in groups work seamlessly flowed, we ended up working in a non-systematic manner when integrating all  technologies and so overall planning of the project can be improved.
- Work delegation could be improved for future tasks so all members can contribute a lot more equally.
- We were a bit late in starting our assignment and that rushed in development preventing ourselves from improving the widget a lot further.


## Things that we learnt
- Working with team members we were able to learn everybody's strengths and how we can utulize them for the upcoming tasks.
- Gained experience in working in a faster environment where new tasks or problems pop up and need to be dealt with promptly.
- More experience with the technologies, in terms of coding as well as Github to improve efficiency for later projects.


## Sprint Goal
- Be more prompt as a team when receiving assignments in order to have ample time to complete them with our best of capabilities.
- Prioritize work distribution and overal project structure when planning our tasks.
