# SWOT Analysis

## Strengths
- Utilization of platforms like GitHub and Slack facilitated seamless collaboration among team members, ensuring efficient task delegation and progress tracking.
- Leveraging GitHub's features such as issues and separate branches showcases the team's adherence to industry standards and efficient organization of the development workflow.
- Our Team's proficiency in standard web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enabled us to implement the widget effectively.
- The Team strictly adhered to Agile Methodology. Our team's approach to dividing tasks and conducting brainstorming sessions showcases an agile mindset, allowing for quick iterations and adaptation to feedback.
- We also ensured to factor in User-Centric Design. Incorporating features like a navigation bar and a submit button, along with a thank you page and back button, reflect a focus on user experience and satisfaction.



## Weaknesses
- The project faces issues with data privacy and security. The page stores sensitive user data without having tools to provide valid security and privacy.
- The team although divided work efficiently, ended up with a disturbed workflow with some teams finishing work earlier leading to integrating technologies in a non-systematic manner.
- The project has an insufficient fallback mechanism for widget failure. In an instance where JavaScript is not present in a web browser some technologies fail. Overall the abscene of a secondary system could result in inefficiency and frustration. 

## Opportunities
- Our team could further implement more features to the website such as recording data and sharing responses to. 
- We can automate a process to email back the responses users give to give feedback for their feedback.
- Connecting our feedback page to future applications and projects to get more use out of the project as well as further developing a team website that the page can connect to. 
- We can further implement more accessibility since the web page does not work without javascript.
- More questions can be added to the feedback form in order to get more detailed responses from the users.


## Threats
- The web page has no security or protection at all and so is at risk of cyber attacks.
