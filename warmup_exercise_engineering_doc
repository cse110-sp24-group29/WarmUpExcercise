## Testing
* **Unit Testing:** 
Unit tests are designed to test individual functions of the webpage to ensure they function correctly in isolation from other parts. The approach involves: Use mocks and stubs to simulate the behavior; Specify what the expected outcome should be for the given input values and compare; Use a test runner and assertions to automatically check if the component behaves as expected.
* **tests:** 
1. testInputField()
Purpose: Tests if text input fields accept input and store the correct values.
Method: Simulates entering text into input fields and checks if the value matches the entered text.
1. testRadioButton()
Purpose: Ensures that radio buttons can be selected and only one selection is allowed at a time within a group.
Method: Clicks each radio button and verifies that the clicked button is checked while others are unchecked.
1. testRatingWidget()
Purpose: Verifies that the rating widget updates the display and internal state when a user selects a rating.
Method: Simulates clicks on each star in the rating widget and checks if the UI updates to reflect the correct rating and if the correct value is stored internally.
1. testFormSubmission()
Purpose: Tests form submission, ensuring the form gathers input data correctly and triggers the submit event.
Method: Fills out the form, triggers a submit, and checks if all data is correctly gathered and submitted without actually sending a request.
