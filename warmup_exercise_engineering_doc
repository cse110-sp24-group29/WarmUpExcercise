# Warmup Project (Sentiment-Widget)

## Objectives
* To derisk our team both in terms of handling technical challenges and managing the workflow within our team. 


## Team Member: Roles
Software Surfers is a team of 12 members:

### Saksham Rai (Team Lead, Developer):
* Brainstormed design and implementation ideas for the entire project. 
* Wrote code to develop: sentiment widget, fallback page, debugging/resolving errors in all HTML, CSS and JS files.
* Created the Engineering Doc.
* Led/Organised all checkin meetings for this project.
* Recorded the demo video. 
* Created initial Github issues and branches to set up the project for everyone to work on smoothly. 

### Aniruddh Krovvidi (Developer): My role involved creating the thank you page with a back button that redirects the user back to the feedback form page. 
To ensure a smooth user experience, I decided to align the items in the center of the screen, as it appealed better to the user.
This decision was made based on user interface design principles, aiming for clarity and ease of navigation.

### Shrey Kumar (Developer):  My role was to create the submit button in the sentiment widget with the design of our group's theme and 
give the functionality to direct the user to the thank you page when they click the button. 

### Ojas Tewari (Designer): Worked on creating the design layout and basic structure. 
### Aditya Saini (Designer): Worked on designing the footer and the navigation bar. 
### Christopher Lerum (Designer): Worked on setting color scheme and appropriate font styles. 

### Tianshi Gong (Tester): Worked on testing.
### Jason Tang (Tester): Worked on testing.

### Brandon Chung (Developer): Worked on reviewing code and updating small CSS changes. 
### Evan Kauh (Developer): Worked on implementing the navigation bar and the hamburger menu.
### Ryan Chon (Developer): Worked on the styling and functionality of the feedback form.

## Development Tools
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
* **Testing:** javascript
* **Designing:** Draw.io
* **Developing:** Visual Studio Code 

## Project Management Tools
* Github
* Slack

## System Architecture
* 3 HTML Pages: index.html (landing feedback page), ty-page.html (feedback submission confirmation), fallback.html (if user comes to this).
* 2 CSS Files: styles.css (to style index.html), fallback_styles.css (to style fallback.html)
* 1 js File: app.js (contains eventloaders to dynamically update the rating widget, navigation bar via mouse hovering/cliking). 
* Control Flow: 
1. User arrives at index.html and fills out the form, including the sentiment - widget. 
2. User presses submit and is routed to the Thank You page, indicating completion of the process. 
3. User presses back to go back to the feedback page. 
4. If the user presses any link on the navigation tab apart from "Feedback", they are routed to the Fallback page. 

## Testing
* **Unit Testing:** 
Unit tests are designed to test individual functions of the webpage to ensure they function correctly in isolation from other parts. The approach involves: Use mocks and stubs to simulate the behavior; Specify what the expected outcome should be for the given input values and compare; Use a test runner and assertions to automatically check if the component behaves as expected.
* **tests:** 
1. testInputField()
Purpose: Tests if text input fields accept input and store the correct values.
Method: Simulates entering text into input fields and checks if the value matches the entered text.
1. testRadioButton()
Purpose: Ensures that radio buttons can be selected and only one selection is allowed at a time within a group.
Method: Clicks each radio button and verifies that the clicked button is checked while others are unchecked.
1. testRatingWidget()
Purpose: Verifies that the rating widget updates the display and internal state when a user selects a rating.
Method: Simulates clicks on each star in the rating widget and checks if the UI updates to reflect the correct rating and if the correct value is stored internally.
1. testFormSubmission()
Purpose: Tests form submission, ensuring the form gathers input data correctly and triggers the submit event.
Method: Fills out the form, triggers a submit, and checks if all data is correctly gathered and submitted without actually sending a request.
